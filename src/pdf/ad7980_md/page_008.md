Stresses at or above those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings may cause permanent damage to the product. This is a stress rating only; functional operation of the product at these or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational section of this specification is not implied.
Operation beyond the maximum operating conditions for extended periods may affect product reliability.

THERMAL RESISTANCE

Thermal performance is directly linked to printed circuit board (PCB) design and operating environment. Careful attention to PCB thermal design is required.

\( \theta_{JA} \) is the natural convection junction to ambient thermal resistance measured in a one cubic foot sealed enclosure.
\( \theta_{JC} \) is the junction to case thermal resistance.
