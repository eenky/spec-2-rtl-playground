ANALOG INPUT

Figure 27 shows an equivalent circuit of the input structure of the AD7980.

The two diodes, D1 and D2, provide ESD protection for the analog inputs, IN+ and IN–. Care must be taken to ensure that the analog input signal never exceeds the supply rails by more than 0.3 V, because this causes these diodes to become forward-biased and start conducting current. These diodes can handle a forward-biased current of 130 mA maximum. For instance, these conditions could eventually occur when the supplies of the input buffer (U1) are different from VDD. In such a case (for example, an input buffer with a short circuit), the current limitation can be used to protect the device.

Figure 27. Equivalent Analog Input Circuit

The analog input structure allows the sampling of the true differential signal between IN+ and IN–. By using these differential inputs, signals common to both inputs are rejected.

During the acquisition phase, the impedance of the analog inputs (IN+ and IN–) can be modeled as a parallel combination of capacitor, C_{PIN}, and the network formed by the series connection of R_{IN} and C_{IN}. C_{PIN} is primarily the pin capacitance. R_{IN} is typically 400 Ω and is a lumped component made up of some serial resistors and the on resistance of the switches. C_{IN} is typically 30 pF and is mainly the ADC sampling capacitor. During the conversion phase, where the switches are opened, the input impedance is limited to C_{PIN}. R_{IN} and C_{IN} make a 1-pole, low-pass filter that reduces undesirable aliasing effects and limits the noise.

When the source impedance of the driving circuit is low, the AD7980 can be driven directly. Large source impedances significantly affect the ac performance, especially THD. The dc performances are less sensitive to the input impedance. The maximum source impedance depends on the amount of THD that can be tolerated. The THD degrades as a function of the source impedance and the maximum input frequency.

DRIVER AMPLIFIER CHOICE

Although the AD7980 is easy to drive, the driver amplifier needs to meet the following requirements:

• The noise generated by the driver amplifier needs to be kept as low as possible to preserve the SNR and transition noise performance of the AD7980. The noise coming from the driver is filtered by the 1-pole, low-pass filter of the AD7980 analog input circuit made by R_{IN} and C_{IN} or by the external filter, if one is used. Because the typical noise of the AD7980 is 47.3 μV rms, the SNR degradation due to the amplifier is

\[
SNR_{LOSS} = 20 \log \left( \frac{47.3}{\sqrt{47.3^2 + \frac{\pi}{2} f_{-3dB} (N e_N)^2}} \right)
\]

where:
f_{-3dB} is the input bandwidth in MHz of the AD7980 (10 MHz) or the cutoff frequency of the input filter, if one is used.
N is the noise gain of the amplifier (for example, 1 in buffer configuration).
e_N is the equivalent input noise voltage of the op amp, in nV/\sqrt{Hz}.

• For ac applications, the driver should have a THD performance commensurate with the AD7980.
• For multichannel multiplexed applications, the driver amplifier and the AD7980 analog input circuit must settle for a full-scale step onto the capacitor array at a 16-bit level (0.0015%, 15 ppm). In the amplifier data sheet, settling at 0.1% to 0.01% is more commonly specified. This can differ significantly from the settling time at a 16-bit level and should be verified prior to driver selection.

The Precision ADC Driver Tool can be used to model the settling behavior and to estimate the ac performance of the AD7980 with a selected driver and RC filter.
